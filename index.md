TODO:
Create a new Github page with a presentation on the concepts of Multivariate Regression Analysis and Gradient Boosting. Include a presentation of Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost).

Apply the regression methods (including lowess and boosted lowess) to real data sets, such as "Cars" and "Boston Housing Data".  Record the cross-validated mean square errors and the mean absolute errors.

For each method and data set report the crossvalidated mean square error and determine which method is achieveng the better results.

In this paper you should also include theoretical considerations, examples of Python coding and plots. 

The final results should be clearly stated.

## Overview

For project three, I applied two regression techniques, Locally Weighted Linear (LOWESS) and Random Forest, on the Boston Housing Dataset. Both regression techniques were then boosted - applying Boosted LOWESS and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The Boston Housing Dataset is derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning homes in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. Although the dataset contains over fifteen columns, each a distinct characteristic of a home in Boston, I will be focusing on only four, applying multivariate regression analysis techniques. The input features will be 'rooms', 'crime', and 'distance' describing the average number of rooms per dwelling, per capita crime rate by town, and weighted distances to five Boston employment centres. The target, which will be predicted, is 'cmedv', the median value of owener-occupied homes (in thousands of dollars).
